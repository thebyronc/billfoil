# React Bill Foil

## Current Status
This is still a work in progress. See Application Dev Plan

## Submission: Personal Development
Explore creating a clean and functional application that I personally will be using on a regular basis. Current concern is that all the applications I've made up to this point has only been exercises for a concept.

Spent some initial time going through the motions of creating an app. I Started going into details of what I would like to create. Once the research begun, I started digging into all the different technologies i would like to eventually leverage.

I have a strong need to start seeing a plan before developing so I started on some early concepts and layout planning.

There were a lot of questions, that range from using Google Drive accounts and how to use React Native.

Ultimate goal for myself is to create a fully functional application.

### Application Dev Plan
- [x] Create Baseline objects and routers.
- [ ] Connect to Firebase for initial data creation and storage
- [ ] Implement OAuth2
- [ ] Connect individual sign-ins with Google Sheets
- [ ] Store parsed data into google sheets so the user can easily see and modify cost information.
- [ ] Re-pull from google sheets to get updated data.
- [ ] Possibly implement REACT Native to publish to Android and IOS
- [ ] Use Expo.io

| Objectives | Current Progress Details|
| --- | --- |
| Implement OAuth2 | Google Drive [OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)  |
|Google Sheets | Based on [REST](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/) routes. GET and POST are used to add and retrieve data from Google Sheets.  |
| Use React Native | [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/): From initial research, React Native can be built in atom and angular.  |
| Expo.io | [Expo.io](https://expo.io/): Created sample phone application by using Expo to quickly deploy to my phone. ![Example](research/example.png) |
